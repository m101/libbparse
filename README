== Binary Parser v0.1 alpha

This project is aimed to have a clean library for parsing binary files and more
specifically, executable files.

For now, this project contain :
- PE parser (WIP)
- ELF parser (WIP)

It is still in it's early development phase, or more commonly known as alpha stage.

Functions that could be considered "stable" (need more testing on 32 bits architecture due to uint64_t):
- PeCheck()
- PeLoad()
- PeGetDosHeader()
- PeGetNtHeader()
- PeGetSectionHeaderTable()
- PeUnload()
- RvaToVa()
- RvaToOffset()
- OffsetToRva()

I'm releasing the source so more people can contribute to it and use it.

Hope you enjoy it,

Don't hesitate to mail me if you have any comment on it.
